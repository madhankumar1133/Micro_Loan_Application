                <p className='mt-2'>Micro loans are short-term loans which comprise of smaller loan amounts which are extended to lower income entities including micro-enterprises/entrepreneurs, low income group families, start-ups, small businesses and basically anyone who is falling short of financial aid to run their businesses and have little to almost no access to this aid.</p>
                <p className='mt-2'>Basically, it is how insurance, credit, money transfers and access to savings accounts are made available for such business owners, more so in the underdeveloped part of the nation. Usually, the recipients of such loans are mainly those who are unable to avail traditional loans such as business and personal loans.</p>
                <p  className='mt-2'>The government of India is helping Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in reaching out to the under banked as well as unbanked people to help then with funding by partnering with micro finance companies (MFCs) and private limited companies. While the primary objective of these short-term loans is to offer financial aid to such companies, it also aims in the smooth functioning of socio-economic development, promoting start-ups, reinforce self-help groups and also encouraging female entrepreneurs to become more independent.</p>
