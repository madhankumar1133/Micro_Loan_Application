                     <p className='mt-3'>While we have gone over the advantages and features of micro loans, it is also imperative to take note of the disadvantages, however few they might be. </p>
                    <h5 className='mt-3'>Harsh repayment criteria: </h5>
                     <p className='mt-3'>Micro finance companies have the authority to impose harsh repayment options in the absence of legitimate working compliances and protocols. This can cause a state of financial crisis and added debt so one must be careful to not get manipulated by unethical repayment practices.</p>
                     <h5 className='mt-3'>Higher Interest Rates: </h5>
                     <p className='mt-3'>Micro finance companies, despite working in compliance with RBI, do not offer low-interest rates on repayment. Since they do not follow the same trends as traditional bank loans in which accumulation of funds can be cumbersome for them, the operating cost becomes high and the borrower has to pay higher interest rates. However, this is a small price to pay, considering the numerous advantages of micro loans.</p>
